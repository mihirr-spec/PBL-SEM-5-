```

### Three seams that keep the roadmap cheap

**1. Role-based routing.** `PortalShell` takes a `role`, guards the route and
renders the chrome. Adding the Faculty portal is a new `src/app/faculty/layout.tsx`
containing `<PortalShell role="faculty">`, plus its entry in `NAV_BY_ROLE`.

**2. A single data boundary.** No component imports `seed.ts`. Everything goes
through `repository.ts`, whose functions are already async. Swapping to Prisma,
Supabase or a REST API means rewriting those function bodies and nothing else.

**3. A forward-looking schema.** `types.ts` defines the entities V1 needs
(`users`, `students`, `faculty`, `projects`, `teams`, `deadlines`,
`announcements`, `notifications`) with the foreign keys that
`weekly_progress`, `certificates`, `marks` and `evaluations` will hang off.

## Design

The palette is sampled from `public/coverpage.png` — ivory and warm sand
surfaces, muted gold from the dome as the accent, soft stone for text. Status
colours (clay, sage, sky, plum) are kept muted so they read as information
rather than decoration. Type is Inter for the interface and Fraunces for
display headings.

All tokens live in the `@theme` block at the top of `src/app/globals.css`.

## Known limits of V1

- Data is in memory. Profile edits and submissions persist for the session;
  a reload restores the seed. Only the signed-in user survives (localStorage).
- File uploads are not implemented. "Mark as submitted" records the
  declaration; attachments arrive with weekly progress reporting in V1.1.
- Faculty and Supervisor sign-in is refused with an explanatory message.
