 * Decorative watercolour bled off a section edge.
 *
 * The marketing sections sit on ivory, so the art is feathered on the side
 * that faces the content and held at low opacity — it reads as the paper the
 * page is printed on rather than as a picture competing with the type. Each
 * section passes a different sketch so the page never repeats itself.
